              Cal3D is a skeletal based 3D character animation library written 
              in C++ in a platform-/graphic API-independent way. Originally designed 
              to be used in a 3D client for Worldforge, it evolved into a stand-alone 
              product which can be used in many different kinds of projects. It 
              supports combining animations and actions through a &quot;mixer&quot; 
              interface, and work is currently underway to integrate morph targets 
              (interpolating between one mesh and another, using the same vertex 
              sequence) easily into the system.</p>

<!--
* Make the list of the root bones a vector. So the root bones can be acceded in C wrapper.
* Add some missing function to access to private variables.
* Add cal3d_converter to the default distribution with manual page and file format description (tools subdirectory is therefore removed)
* The destructor of CalModel is now virtual.
* Made CalModel noncopyable to prevent shallow pointer copying bugs.
* Use a RefCounted base class and RefPtr smart pointers to hold RefCounted objects.
* Make CalModel destructor nonvirtual
* Improve bounding boxes calculation performance.
* Update the C wrapper.
* Add some function to rotate around axis during the loading.
* When a cycle animation is played, ensure that the last post equals the first pose.
* Extended callback mechanism to pass user data directly instead of making the callback query for it. This means the callback executable does not have to link with cal3d.lib and makes many things simpler in CS context. Also worked around a bug (feature?) in the mixer which thinks that m_AnimDuration is always 0 for AnimActions. Now the callback uses the internal time counter of the animation, which is probably more consistent anyway.
* VC6 and automake fixes. Removed old variables from src/cal3d/Makefile.am.
* 64bit compatibility fixes.
* Patch for reading correctly raw texture on a Big endian cpu (for Mac).
* Fixed bug in updating current anim time when time factor is set to negative.
* Correction in max exporters.
* Update the glew (The OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library).
* Made the refcounted classes derive from RefCounted, and manage their lifetimes with RefPtr smart pointers.
* Put TinyXML into the cal3d namespace so it doesn't conflict with other libraries linking with their own TinyXML.
* Fixed bug in updating current anim time when time factor is set to negative, which resuilted in anim times like -32 instead of between 0 and 2 seconds, for example. This threw the bone extrapolations way off and made the model look like garbage until the anim time got back in the right zone. (Keith Fulton)
* GNU/Linux compilation / packaging fixes (-DCAL_16BIT_INDICES is included if relevant in the .pc)
* Upgraded the guide
